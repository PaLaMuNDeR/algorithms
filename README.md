#02 - Reversed string

For a given string - print out the reversed the string
For example:
`reversed_string("abc") = "cba" `

# 03 - Fibonacci
Print the first n fibonacci numbers
A series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
The simplest is the series `1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.`

# 04 - Palindrome
Given a string, return *True* if the string is palindrome
 or *False* if it is not. Palindromes are strings that
 form the same word if it is reversed. *Do* include spaces
 and punctuation in determining if the string is a palindrome.

```
 Examples:
     palindrome('abba') = True
     palindrome('abc')  = False
```

#05 Reverse Integer

Given an integer return an integer that is the reverse

Examples:
reverseInt(15) -> 51
reverseInt(189) -> 981
reverseInt(500) -> 5
reverseInt(-15) -> -51
reverseInt(-90) -> -9

#06 Max Char
Given a string, return the character that is most commonly used in the string.

```
Examples:

maxChar("abcccccccdef") -> "c"
maxChar("apple 12311111") -> "1"
```

#07 FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

```
Example:
fizzbuzz(15)
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```
